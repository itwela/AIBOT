# Itwela's Ai Trading Bot
Im trying to find a way to integrate pinescript into GitHub. regardless, I will have my bots progress hosted on a website and will have a blog section to give insights and updates. I want it to look modern and I want it to change the way people look at investing. 

My next steps are to get this test data and link it with chart.js
