# Itwela's Ai Trading Bot

My attempt at integrating pinescript with GitHub via custom API for trading bot automation and management. Website with modern UI/UX and blog for bot performance, insights, and updates. Innovative investing with data analysis and Statistical methods.


  Why am I doing this?
  
I have been trading for over 5 years. I’ve traded stocks, crypto, CFDs, futures, NFTs, etc. I have seen some success but I will not sit here and say that I’ve found the holy grail yet. Recently, I’ve gone from just taking an interest in coding to knowing I want to do this full-time and am pursuing a software engineering degree. The reason this is important is because every day I am learning how to use software engineering to exponentially test theories I have in the market. Some may say they are far-fetched but I want to prove that I and anybody can make money consistently trading. If this project is successful, it would make the countless hours and years of studying technical analysis and financial jargon worthwhile and hopefully show employers or future partners that I have some skills. I want my work to speak for me.

I have come to find out that in tradingview, there is an issue with something called repainting. Basically you get false signals that your original strategy never even shows was taken. Because of this, I may not be able to run my algos on ALL pairs listed YET, but I find a way to battle the repainting and came up with a strategy that I believe is profitable enough to do better than professional traders. I am currently forward testing (Using Live Data) my bot to CONFIRM that the repainting issue is fixed. Once the forward testing is completed I decided it would be best to try a funded challenge. The risk is surprisingly small there and if successful, I would be (We would I guess)a professional trader and would have proved my point. 

March 31:

I let the algo run from Wednesday to Friday and I made 1% in thise 2 days. With ironically a 60% win rate. Which is exactly in line with my longer backtest. Next week, Im going to run tbe algo on a challenge account. I was definitely scared but I wanted to see how it dealt with drawdown and before I knew it it was up 1%. and it lost SIX time and still ended up with my expected profit for the week. Im excited but still nervous to start this for real but theres no time better than right now!
