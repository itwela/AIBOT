# Itwela's Ai Trading Bot

My attempt at integrating pinescript with GitHub via custom API for trading bot automation and management. Website with modern UI/UX and blog for bot performance, insights, and updates. Innovative investing with data analysis and Statistical methods.


  Why am I doing this?
  
I have been trading for over 5 years. I’ve traded stocks, crypto, CFDs, futures, NFTs, etc. I have seen some success but I will not sit here and say that I’ve found the holy grail yet. Recently, I’ve gone from just taking an interest in coding to knowing I want to do this full-time and am pursuing a software engineering degree. The reason this is important is because every day I am learning how to use software engineering to exponentially test theories I have in the market. Some may say they are far-fetched but I want to prove that I and anybody can make money consistently trading. If this project is successful, it would make the countless hours and years of studying technical analysis and financial jargon worthwhile and hopefully show employers or future partners that I have some skills. I want my work to speak for me.


Currently, I have 2 algorithims that I belive will work consistently. One for XXXJPY Pairs and another For CFDS specifically NAS100, US30 and GER30.

My plan is to run the algorithm with EURJPY to build equity up. Im going to start with 50 dollars and just keep adding to the account as I get paid until I get it to around 500. Hopefully with the EURJPY algo on, it wont take AS long. Once I get to 500, Im going to switch to ONE CFD (Probably GER30). Once equity builds up based on running on GER30, I will then turn on the bot for NAS100, and then US30 after more equity builds.

From my findings so far, I have leanred a great deal. The biggest thing Ive learned so far is the power of taking SMALL profits. I cant wait to show the power of the findings I have found and will continue to find.


UPDATE:

I have come to find out that in tradingview, there is an issue with something called repainting. Basically you get false signals that your original strategy never even shows was taken. Because of this, I may not be able to run my algos on ALL pairs listed YET, but I find a way to battle the repainting and came up with a strategy that I believe is profitable enough to do better than professional traders. I am currently forward testing (Using Live Data) my bot to CONFIRM that the repainting issue is fixed. Once the forward testing is completed I decided it would be best to try a funded challenge. The risk is surprisingly small there and if successful, I would be (We would I guess)a professional trader and would have proved my point.
