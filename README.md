# Itwela's Ai Trading Bot

My attempt at integrating pinescript with GitHub via custom API for trading bot automation and management. Website with modern UI/UX and blog for bot performance, insights, and updates. Innovative investing with data analysis and Statistical methods.


  Why am I doing this?
  
I have been trading for over 5 years. Ive traded stocks, crypto, cfds, futures, nfts, etc. I have seen SOME succes but I will not sit here and say that I've found the holy grail yet. Recently, Ive gone from just taking an interest into coding, to knowing I want to do this full time and am pursuing a
software engineering degree. The reason this is important is becausse everyday I am learning how to use software engineering to exponentially test theories I have in the market. Some may say are farfetched but I want to prove I and anybody CAN make money consistently trading. This project if succesful would make the countless hours, years, studying about technical analysis, hours upon hours of studying finacial jargon and hopefully show to even employers or future partners that I have some skills. I want my work to speak for me. 


My next steps are to get this test data and link it with chart.js
